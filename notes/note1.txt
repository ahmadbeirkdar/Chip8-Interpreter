The CHIP8 CPU has 34 instructions


CHIP8:

    16 8-bit Registers:
        Dedicated location on CPU for storage
        Operations done by the CPU must be done within the Registers
        Labeled V0 to VF
        Holds 0x00 to 0xFF
        Register VF is used as a flag to hold information about the result of operations

    4096 Bytes of Memory:
        Address space from 0x000 to 0xFFF
        0x000-0x1FF - Originally reserved for the CHIP8 interpreter itself. 
        0x050-0x0A0 - Storage space for the 16 characters 0 to F
        0x200-0xFFF - instructions of the ROM will be stored here starting from 0x200, anything left is free to use

    16-bit Index Register:
        Special register used to store memory addresses for operations
        16 bits as the maximum memory address is 0xFFF

    16-bit Program Counter
        Special register which holds the address of the next instruction to execute
        16 bits as the maximum memory address is 0xFFF
        NEEDS MORE INFO 

    16 Level Stack:
        Keeps track of the order of executions when it calls into functions for the CPU 
        An instruction CALL will cause the PCU to execute instructions in a different region of the program
        when the program reaches the instruction RET it must go back to where it was when it hit CALL
        The stack holds the PC value when the CALL instruction was executed.
        So the RETURN statement pulls the address of the CALL from the stack so it will execute the next cycle
        The CHIP8 has 16 levels of the stack so 16 different PCs 
        Putting a PC onto the stack is called pushing
        Pulling a PC from the stack is called popping

    8-bit Stack Pointer
        Tells us where in the 16 level stack the most recent value was placed.
        8-bits is used as the stack will be represented as an array so the stack pointer is just the index to the array
        When a value is popped off the stack it wont be deleted just the stack pointer will be decremented

    8-bit Delay Timer:
        Time for timing
        If the timer value is zero, stays zero
        If it is set with any value it will decrement at a rate of whatever the cycle clock is set to

    8-bit Sound Timer:
        Timer for Sound
        If set to zero, stays zero
        If set to a value decrements at a rate of 60Hz

    Input 16 Keys:
        Input keys threw 0 to F 
    
    64x32 Display Memory:
        Memory buffer used to store graphics for the Display
        unint32 per each pixel
        ON 0xFFFFFFFF
        OFF 0x00000000
