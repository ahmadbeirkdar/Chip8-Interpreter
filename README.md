Currently I am using a premade "Platform Layer" to test out if the interpreter I wrote works, and it does wonderfully(check the video).

Next step is to possibly learn more about how to render on the screen correctly using SDL or OpenGL and get input, and implement it by myself. 

But the main part of the project, is the interpreter :)

Currently working on it. This project is mainly going to be done for fun, and learning. As I plan to learn more about interpreters and soon compilers.
